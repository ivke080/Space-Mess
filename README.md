# Space Mess
<p>This is the game (demo) made entirely in C++ using Glut library and OpenGl for Computer Graphics course</p>
## Different enemies and their attack patterns
### Boss
Three attack patterns:
<ol>
<li>Shotgun (3 waves of 5 bullets in different directions around the player)</li>
<li>Line (15 bullets - 1 bullet every .5 seconds)</li>
<li>Burst (3 bullets slightly faster than the others)</li>
</ol>
### Sniper
Single attack: Fast bullet that deals alot of damage
### Kamikaze

<p>p.s. Easy to play, hard to master. Enjoy the demo :)</p>
<p>p.s.s. I didn't use any of the models, it's kinda hard to implement that with 
this version of opengl and glut </p>
